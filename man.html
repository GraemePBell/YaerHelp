				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p><i>YaerZero</i> is an ebook reader, currently supporting:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>ePub 2</b></li>
					<li><b>ePub 3</b></li>
					<li><b>CBZ</b> graphic novels and comics</li>
					<li><b>CBR</b> graphic novels and comics</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div style="clear:both">
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h4>ePub 2.x and 3.x</h4>
			<p> These are open standards for electronic books, created and maintained by the <b><a
						href="https://idpf.org/epub/dir/">International Digital Publishing Forum</a></b> (IDPF).
				<b>ePub</b> files are essentially zipped collections of <i>XHTML</i> files, images, <i>CSS</i>
				stylesheets, and various <i>metadata</i> files. <i>YaerZero</i> supports both <b>ePub2</b> and
				<b>ePub3</b> formats, allowing users to read a wide variety of ebooks with rich formatting and
				multimedia content.
			</p>
			<p><b>ePub</b> format books are available from various sources, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> is dedicated to preserving free public
					domain books in various formats. </li>
				<li> <a href="https://standardebooks.org/">Standard Ebooks</a> provide beautifully formatted versions of
					<b>Project Gutenberg</b> ebooks.
				</li>
				<li> <a href="https://www.smashwords.com/">Smashwords</a> is an ebook retailer serving readers around
					the globe. </li>
				<li> <a href="https://openlibrary.org/">Open Library</a> is an open, editable library catalog, building
					towards a web page for every book ever published. </li>
				<li> <a href="https://manybooks.net/">ManyBooks</a> was established in 2004 with the vision of providing
					an extensive library of books in digital format for free on the Internet. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Plus many, many more.</p>
		</div>
		<div style="clear:both"><br /></div>
		<div style="clear:both">
			<p><i>YaerZero</i> supports as much of these standards as is required to view most DRM-free books available
				at the time of writing. It does not support audiobook or synchronised audio-reading capabilities. At all
				times it should degrade gracefully.</p>
			<h4>CBZ and CBR (CBx)</h4>
			<p> <b>CBZ</b> (<i>Comic Book Zip</i>) and <b>CBR</b> (<i>Comic Book Rar</i>) are popular formats for
				digital comics and graphic novels. These formats are essentially compressed archives (<b>ZIP</b> for
				<b>CBZ</b> and <b>RAR</b> for <b>CBR</b>) containing a series of image files that represent the pages of
				the comic. <i>YaerZero</i> allows users to read <b>CBZ</b> and <b>CBR</b> files, providing an optimal
				reading experience for graphic content. Where the archive contains a <i>ComicInfo.xml</i> file,
				<i>YaerZero</i> will use that to display Author, Artist, Title and any Description present.
			</p>
			<p> As the only difference between these formats is the type of compression used, we will refer to both of
				these formats as <b>CBx</b>, unless it matters. </p>
			<p><b>CBx</b> format comics can be found on various platforms, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> <a href="https://www.digitalcomicmuseum.com/">Digital Comic Museum</a> — a free online library of
					public domain Golden Age comics. </li>
				<li> <a href="https://getcomics.info/">GetComics</a> — a website offering a wide range of free comic
					book downloads in <b>CBx</b> formats. </li>
				<li> <a href="https://comicbookplus.com/">Comic Book +</a> — a massive site where every day is party
					day! The original, and still the best site to read and download Golden Age comic books. They also
					hold a large and growing selection of Silver Age comic books, comic strips, pulp fiction, old time
					radio (OTR), fanzines, a lively and active forum, plus lots more. </li>
			</ul>
			<p> Collections of both free and paid content are available from many other sources as well. We highly
				recommend supporting your favourite authors and artists by purchasing their work through legitimate
				channels. </p>
			<p> The <a href="https://humblebundle.com"><b>Humble Bundle</b></a> site is an excellent source for
				collected works in various fields and formats at very reasonable prices. They regularly have textbooks
				and comic collections at significant discounts. </p>
			<p> A good source of information on ebook formats is <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-book#File_formats">Wikipedia's E-book File Formats</a>

			<h3>The Initial Experience – An Overview</h3>
			<h4>When you first launch <i>YaerZero</i></h4>

			<img class="responsive" src="Screenshot 2025-12-12 190935.png" alt="YaerZero Initial Interface Screenshot"
				style="float: right; margin-left:1em;" />

			<p>You will see an interface resembling the one to the right:</p>
			<p>
				At the top is the familiar menu bar with our application icon and name,
				some space, and three icons.
			</p>

			<h5>The Menu Bar Icons</h5>
			<ul style="overflow:auto">
				<li>
					<span style="font-family: 'Segoe Fluent Icons'; font-size:16pt;"><b></b></span>
					Help and documentation.<br /><br />
				</li>
				<li>
					<span style="font-family: 'Segoe Fluent Icons'; font-size:16pt;"><b></b></span>
					Full Screen Experience Toggle.<br /><br />
				</li>
				<li>
					<span style="font-family: 'Segoe Fluent Icons'; font-size:16pt;"><b></b></span>
					Theme Toggle.<br /><br />
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				To the right, there is the usual Windows furniture —
				<b>Minimize</b>, <b>Maximize</b>/<b>Restore</b>, and <b>Close</b> buttons.
			</p>

			<hr width="25%" />

			<h4>The Main Library Window</h4>
			<p><br /></p>

			<h5>The untitled top-left section</h5>
			<p>We have our default cover, bearing the <i>YaerZero</i> name.</p>

			<p>
				The image used for the application icon and for the default book cover
				is of <i>Trinity College Library</i> in Dublin. This beautiful library
				is the current home of <i>The Book of Kells</i>. The original photograph
				was taken by Graeme P. Bell, and the final image was created using
				<i>Paint.NET</i>. No AI tools were used.
			</p>

			<p>
				When a book is selected, this image will change to the cover (if any)
				present in the selected ebook.
			</p>

			<p>
				The bar beneath the image will show roughly how much reading progress
				has been made in the selected book. <b>Title</b>, <b>Author</b>,
				<b>Artist</b>, and <b>Description</b> will be replaced by values from
				the selected ebook.
			</p>

			<h5>Recent Books</h5>
			<p>
				Located at the top right, this section displays a list of the six most
				recently accessed books, including any that have been newly loaded.
			</p>

			<p>
				Each entry includes:
				<br /><br />
				• A small book cover thumbnail for visual identification.<br />
				• The book title displayed prominently.<br />
				• The author's name listed below the title.<br /><br />
				This section allows users to quickly resume reading their most recent
				selections.
			</p>

			<h5>Library Navigation</h5>
			<p>
				A dedicated Library section allows users to browse either their complete
				collection or a filtered view.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<span style="font-family: 'Segoe Fluent Icons'; font-size:16pt;"><b></b></span>
					<b>Filter</b> drop-down (default: "<b>All</b>"). This enables users
					to narrow down the displayed books based on whether the book is an
					<b>ePub</b> or a <b>CBx</b>.<br /><br />
				</li>

				<li>
					<span style="font-family: 'Segoe Fluent Icons'; font-size:16pt;"><b></b></span>
					<b>Sort</b> drop-down (default: "<b>Title</b>") to organize entries
					by <b>Title</b> or <b>Author</b>.<br /><br />
				</li>

				<li>
					<span style="font-family: 'Segoe Fluent Icons'; font-size:16pt;"><b></b></span>
					<b>Search</b> enables a search box, which filters the library in
					real-time based on the entered text, matching against either
					<b>Title</b> or <b>Author</b>.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h5>The Bottom Bar</h5>
			<p>
				At the bottom-left is the grayed-out
				<span style="font-family: 'Segoe Fluent Icons'; font-size:16pt;"><b></b></span>
				<b>Current Book</b> button. When a book is being read, this will display
				the name of the book, and selecting it will open the book in the reading
				view.
			</p>

			<p>
				The <b>Details View</b> button is a toggle. Initially,
				<i>YaerZero</i> loads with the library in <b>Covers</b> mode, displaying
				book covers and reading progress for each volume. Swapping to
				<b>Details</b> mode displays a smaller version of the cover, Title,
				Author, and progress.
			</p>

			<p>
				And finally we have the
				<span style="font-family: 'Segoe Fluent Icons'; font-size:16pt;"><b></b></span>
				<b>Add Book</b> button — selecting this will bring up a multiple-select
				file-picker dialog box.

		<div style="clear:both">
			<h3 style="clear: both;">Adding Books to <i>YaerZero</i></h3>

			<h4>By File Picker...</h4>
			<p>
				Books can be added using the file-picker dialog box to browse the user's system.
				The user may import a single book, and <i>YaerZero</i> will open the reader view
				as soon as it has processed enough to do so. Once the “working” indicator in the
				bottom right finishes, the book will be safely stored in the library and the full
				functionality of <i>YaerZero</i> will be available.
			</p>

			<p>
				If multiple books are imported simultaneously, <i>YaerZero</i> will not return
				control until all selected books have been imported — unless the user chooses to
				cancel the process.
			</p>

			<h4>By Double-Clicking, Right-Clicking/Long-Hold and Select...</h4>
			<p>
				If <i>YaerZero</i> is the default reader (for <b>.epub</b>, <b>.cbz</b> and
				<b>.cbr</b> files), double-clicking on a book file will import the book into the
				library and launch the reader view as soon as enough of the book has been processed.
				This may result in some images not being in place initially, but do not be concerned —
				<i>YaerZero</i> will continue working in the background and will finish importing.
				The user may even switch to another book in the library.
			</p>

			<p>
				Once the “working” indicator in the bottom right finishes, the new book will be
				safely stored in the library, with all elements in place.
			</p>

			<p><b>Drag-and-Drop...</b></p>
			<p>
				The user may use <i>Drag-and-Drop</i> to import single or multiple files, with the
				same caveats as using the file-picker.
			</p>

			<h4><b>Single Book vs Multiple Book Import</b></h4>
			<p>
				When importing multiple books, <i>YaerZero</i> will disable most of its user interface
				while working. If a single book is imported, it will endeavour to return control as
				quickly as possible, presenting the ebook in readable form while disabling only those
				parts of the user experience that require a completely processed book.
			</p>

			<p>
				This is recommended when the user has a single new book they wish to read
				<i style="font-weight: bold;">now!</i> Multiple books may be imported <i>en masse</i>;
				however, this is only recommended when building a library from a pre-existing folder.
				It can be very slow.
			</p>

			<h4>Speed of Processing</h4>
			<p>
				<i>YaerZero</i> imports ebooks by decompressing the original file and processing the
				contents into a format that can be rapidly presented back to the user.
			</p>

			<p>
				This process can be extremely swift for a plain <i>Gutenberg.org</i> <b>ePub</b> of a
				short story, or it may be much slower for an omnibus edition <b>CBx</b> of a long-running
				graphic novel series.
			</p>

			<p>
				The author has found that the very slowest books to process are generally heavily
				illustrated textbooks by reputable publishers. They tend to have interesting structures
				(often requiring reformatting into canonical <b>ePub</b> format before they can be
				processed) and many hundreds, or even thousands, of relatively small images.
			</p>

			<p>
				At its fastest, <i>YaerZero</i> will complete processing before the user realises it has
				even started. At its slowest, it’s time for a coffee.
			</p>

			<p>
				However, once a book is processed and present in the library, load times are extremely rapid.
			</p>

			<h4>Library Size</h4>
			<p>
				<i>YaerZero</i> accesses local storage to store, manage, and present books. A large processed
				library will eventually cause <i>YaerZero</i> to slow down in daily use. We have tested it with
				libraries of over 1500 books of various kinds, and it is still quite usable, but we recommend
				smaller libraries of perhaps 200 processed books or fewer to keep performance snappy.
			</p>

			<p>
				We also note that while <b>ePub</b> formatted books are generally small (often less than
				1 <i>Megabyte</i>), <b>CBx</b> graphic novels can run to many <i>Gigabytes</i>! Storing a processed
				version can be wasteful of space. Once they have been read, the user should remove them from the
				<i>YaerZero</i> library (<i>please</i> keep backups of your original books).

			</p>

			<p class="text-3">
				Double‑tapping on the book in any of these three locations will open the book in the

				style="float: left; margin-right:1em; max-width: 50%;" />

			<p>
				The <b>Reader</b> view is intended to minimize distractions, allowing readers
				to focus on the content of their chosen book.
			</p>

			<p>
				All user interface controls are found at the edges of the app, away from the
				main content area.
			</p>

			<h3>The Title Bar</h3>

			<p>
				In addition to the controls already described for the <b>Library</b> view,
				the Reader View adds two new buttons to the Title Bar for <b>ePub</b> books.
				They will not be present for <b>CBx</b> books.
			</p>

			<p>
				These allow adjustments to the document font size for reading comfort.
				<i>YaerZero</i> attempts to honour the book’s intended typography and does
				not support user-selected typefaces.

				These buttons move through the book one page at a time. When going backwards
				through a chapter break, they go to the <i>end</i> of the previous chapter.
			</p>

			<p>
				If the reading system has a mouse with a scroll wheel, <i>YaerZero</i> will

		<p>
			The release version of <i>YaerZero</i> is the end of a very long road.
		</p>

		<p>
			<i>YaerZero</i> started as a hobby project, just to keep my hand in as a coder.
			It was originally written in C++/CLI using Visual Studio 2012 and .NET Framework 4.5,
			aiming to be compatible with Windows Phone 8.0 as well as Windows 8.0.
			That proved to be a lot harder than expected, due to incomplete API support for many
			required features. Sandboxing and security restrictions made a lot of potential
			approaches far more difficult than they should have been. It became obvious that
			.NET on Windows Phone was a significant pain point.
		</p>

		<p>
			The rapid evolution to Windows 8.1 and then to Windows 10 kept moving the goalposts.
			The decision was made to switch to UWP and C++/CX, which promised better support for
			the required features and removed the dependency on the .NET Framework.
			This was a significant rewrite, abandoning Windows Phone along the way, but it paid off
			in the end, allowing easy access to a large subset of traditional Win32 APIs,
			modern UWP design, and real C++11/14/17 for fast performance.
		</p>

		<p>
			The UI went from a test harness spilling out raw XHTML to a fully featured UWP XAML
			interface, with support for touch, mouse, keyboard, and pen input. The reading engine
			went from a simple WebView loading raw XHTML to a full-featured ebook processor,
			supporting both <b>ePub2</b> and <b>ePub3</b>, as well as <b>CBZ</b> and <b>CBR</b>
			graphic novels and comics.
		</p>

		<p>
			<i>YaerZero</i> is currently written in C++17 using
			<i>Microsoft Visual Studio 2026 (Community Edition)</i>, with embedded JavaScript,
			HTML, and CSS where required.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>ePub</b> processing requires handling ZIP decompression.
			The unzip decompression algorithm is public domain. Many different C language
			implementations were examined before deciding to implement a more focused C++ version,
			better suited to the task than a generalised unzip library.
		</p>

		<p>
			Once unzip was working and <b>ePub</b> processing was functional, it seemed obvious to
			add <b>CBZ</b> support. Indeed, it “just worked” once a presentation format compatible
			with the existing UI was decided upon.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>CBR</b> was a very different deal. Once decompressed, it would slot straight into the
			<b>CBZ</b> handling pipeline. Decompression was the problem.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>CBR</b> uses <b>RAR</b> compression, which is proprietary to
			<a href="https://www.win-rar.com/"><i>RARLAB</i></a>.
			The command-line and linkable-library UnRAR C++ source is publicly available on
			<a href="https://github.com/pmachapman/unrar">GitHub</a> free to use, as long as it is
			not used to reverse-engineer the RAR compression algorithm.
			The current README and license are available at the link above.
			UnRAR also contains other sources that require (and deserve) acknowledgement —
			please refer to
			<a href="https://github.com/pmachapman/unrar/blob/master/acknow.txt">acknow.txt</a>
			for further details.
		</p>

		<p>
			UnRAR has a long history. Over the years, the codebase has accumulated several
			generations of legacy C++ constructs, many of which represent best practices from
			earlier times but are no longer relevant today. It is an actively maintained codebase,
			with stability and backwards compatibility at its core. Old code that has been tested
			and proven over many years is not lightly discarded, giving us a fascinating peek into
			the history of C++ development practices.
		</p>

		<p>
			The earliest parts look very much like C code, with manual memory management and pointer
			arithmetic throughout. Later parts show increasing use of C++ features such as classes,
			templates, and exceptions. Modern C++ features — smart pointers, STL containers, etc. —
			have been introduced incrementally where new code has been written, bugs fixed, or
			improvements made. It is a patchwork of different styles and practices, reflecting the
			evolution of C++ over the years.
		</p>

		<p>
			Examination of the UnRAR source made it very clear that it would require either a
			significant rewrite of the command-line driven program to fit within the UWP framework
			of <i>YaerZero</i>, or linking in the compiled library. The decision was made to rewrite
			and avoid an opaque black box at the core of the application. The UnRAR codebase is large
			and complex, and the rewrite took many months of work. It was necessary to understand the
			entire codebase, as well as the intricacies of the RAR compression format, in order to
			produce a working equivalent.
		</p>

		<p>
			A small fraction of the original code <i>does</i> survive intact and unchanged, and none
			of the revised code would exist without being able to refer back to the original source.
			Frequently, debugging required running a debug build of UnRAR alongside a build of
			<i>YaerZero</i>, comparing behaviour of the dictionary window in memory at the individual
			byte level. Many thanks to the original UnRAR authors for making this possible.
			Not sarcasm.
		</p>

		<p>
			As an observation: RAR decompression is extremely fast compared with ZIP decompression.
			Despite the extra complexity of the RAR format, it is significantly faster. The author
			suspects this is due to the use of larger dictionary sizes (4MB, or 32MB in v5.0+,
			versus 32K), making better use of modern hardware and allowing for better compression
			ratios and faster decompression speeds. The ZIP format has not evolved much since its
			inception in the DOS era of the late 1980s, while RAR has continued to evolve with new
			features and improvements.

			<b>Future directions</b>.<br />
			I hope to move the project to C++/WinRT in the near future, to take advantage of the
			more modern language projections and better support for asynchronous programming.
			This will be a significant effort, but one that will improve the maintainability and
			performance of the application. That would allow me to update the codebase to C++20
			and beyond.
		</p>

		<p>
			I may also move to WebView2 for rendering, as WebView is being deprecated. This would
			allow better support for modern web standards and enable more rendering effects.

		<h3>AI Statement</h3>

		<p>
			The first commit to this project was made in 2015 — well before any publicly
			available AI coding assistants became available.
		</p>

		<p>
			In May 2024, Copilot was integrated into Visual Studio 2022, and I was initially
			hostile to using it. I soon discovered that it was a very good way of finding
			documentation — a process that has become increasingly frustrating over the years.
			I remember when the Win32 API reference and Stroustrup were all that was required,
			but those days are long past.
		</p>

		<p>
			With later revisions, I have found AI to be generally helpful at finding information
			outside of my core competencies, but it is still overconfident, obsequious, and prone
			to hallucination. While AI has been used to review code and suggest technical
			improvements, there is no purely AI‑generated code within <i>YaerZero</i>.
			Most of it was written before AI was available. Nothing has been copy‑pasted without
			significant revision and testing.
		</p>

		<p>
			The most frequent use, outside of finding documentation, has been generating complex
			regular expressions.
		</p>

		<p>
			Copilot <i>has</i> been very satisfying to complain to when dealing with the frustrations
			of very bad design decisions that crop up far too often in UWP.
		</p>

		<p>
			I believe that AI is a tool, and like any tool, it can be misused. It is not a replacement
			for human creativity, judgement, or skill. It is a supplement.
			Copilot wrote this paragraph. ;)
		</p>

		<p>
			Just say NO! to Vibe‑Coding.
