			<p>
				These are open standards for electronic books, created and maintained by the <b><a
						href="https://idpf.org/epub/dir/">International Digital Publishing Forum</a></b> (IDPF). ePub
				files
				are essentially zipped collections of XHTML files, images, CSS stylesheets, and metadata files. YaerZero
				supports both ePub 2.x and ePub 3.x formats, allowing users to read a wide variety of ebooks with rich
				formatting and multimedia content.
			</p>
			<p>

					formats.

				image
				files that represent the pages of the comic. YaerZero allows users to read CBZ and CBR files, providing
				an
				optimal reading experience for graphic content.
